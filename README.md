## Introduction

Based on [3BodyProblem](https://github.com/cartertrafton/3BodyProblem), we explore the mesmerizing chaos of the three-body problem by mapping the real-time trajectories of three celestial bodies into ambient music. Each bodyâ€™s velocity and XY position are dynamically translated into various musical features, creating a unique sonic landscape that mirrors their movement through space. Users can actively influence the unfolding musical composition by adjusting the gravitational constant. This adjustment modifies the chaos inherent in the three-body motion, offering a tangible connection between user input and auditory output. Engage with this installation to experience a harmonious blend of physics and sound, where every change in the system brings a new wave of auditory exploration.


## Features
- physics simulation
- multi-body gravitational interaction
- reset and exit functions
- pygame-based interface



## Installation
1. You must have:
  - pygame
  - numpy
2. Clone project and run `python3 main.py`
3. Open MAX/MSP and you may need to change the output routing (Like "From MAX2")
4. Open Ableton Project and have fun!
